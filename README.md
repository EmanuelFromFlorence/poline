color palette generator mico-lib

> "Poline" is a mystical color palette generator, shrouded in mystery. It does 
> not rely on the science of color, but rather is crafted to enchant the eye. 
> It weaves lines of magic between anchors, using the ancient knowledge of 
> polar coordinates. It is a tool for the modern generative sorcerer, and a 
> delight for the eye.
